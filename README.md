# python-bin-packing

We wrote the YEAH folder, the bin_packing.py and bin_packing_wc.py files, and the runner.py and test.py files. The paxtonDriver.py file was written by the professor of CSCI338 Computer Science Theory, John Paxton, and the visualizer files and other driver files were written by the TA, Alex Huleatt, whose original repo can be found here: https://github.com/Alex-Huleatt/Bin-Packing
